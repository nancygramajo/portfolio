            <div class="description">
                <p>Luna De Xelajú is a Guatemalan restaurant located in San Rafael, California.</p>

    <div class="context">
      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>For this project, I chose to redesign the website for Luna De Xelajú, a beloved restaurant in my hometown. 
        My goal was to practice redesigning a simple website and addressing usability issues to enhance the overall user experience. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>Upon analyzing Luna De Xelajú's existing website, I identified several areas for improvement, 
        including difficulties in navigation, lack of accessibility, and scattered information. 
        These issues hindered their website's ability to effectively showcase their restaurant's offerings and engage 
        with potential customers.
        Improving their website is important for Luna De Xelajú to attract new customers and provide a seamless 
        online experience that reflects the quality of its food and service.

    <div class="research">
      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>I analyzed Luna De Xelajú’s website through manual inspection and accessibility testing tools like WebAIM WAVE. 
        I identified the target audience as new and existing customers looking to view the menu, place an online order, 
        or contact the restaurant. I also analyzed other restaurants’ websites, specifically highly rated restaurants 
        to identify best practices and gather inspiration for the redesign. 
      </p>
      <p>Some notes on the problems I found:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is difficult to see the photo behind their logo and information on the landing page
        </li>
        <li>Their landing page has text in Spanish
        </li>
        <li>Their address is not correctly spelled
        </li>
        <li>
          There are no links to their Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram pages even though they include the icons
        </li>
        <li>
          When you click on the Menu tab, you are taken to a different page where you don't immediately see the entire menu, 
          it looks more like an ordering page
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="process">
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <h4>Sketching</h4>
      <p>
        I began by sketching 9 different possible layouts for the website and I made one final sketch of the layout I liked the most.   
      </p>
      <div class="sketches">
        <img src="images/9 Sketches.jpeg">
        <img src="images/Final Sketch.jpeg">
      </div>

      <div class="wireframe 1">
        <h4>Wireframes</h4>
        <p>Then I created a low-fidelity wireframe in Figma using my final sketch. I created wireframes for three different 
          types of devices: desktop, tablet, and mobile, as these are all the devices I could anticipate people using to view
          Luna De Xelajú's website. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mackbook"> 
        <h5>Low-fidelity wireframe for Macbook</h5>
      </div>

      <img src="images/low-fi laptop 3.png" class="low-fi-pic">


      <div class="tablet"> 
        <h5>Low-fidelity wireframe for iPad</h5>
      </div>

      <img src="images/low-fi ipad 1.png" class="low-fi-pic">

      <div class="phone"> 
        <h5>Low-fidelity wireframe for iPhone</h5>
      </div>

      <img src="images/low-fi iphone 1.png" class="low-fi-pic">
      <img src="images/low-fi iphone 2.png" class="low-fi-pic">
      
      <div class="high-fidelity">
        <p>I then created my high-fidelity mock up for each of the different devices. I incorporated all of the elements from low-fidelity wireframes. 
          When thinking about the aesthics of the website, I chose a style guide that I believed would best capture the culture and ambiance
          of Luna De Xelajú. 
        </p>

      <div class="mackbook"> 
        <h5>High-fidelity wireframe for Macbook</h5>

    <div class="learnings">
      <h3>Learnings</h3>
      <p>
        Through the redesign process, I gained valuable insights into the importance of accessibility and user-centered design. 
        I learned what accessibility-friendly elements in websites look like and how to incorporate them into 
        HTML/CSS for my website. At first, it was difficult to settle on a design that I liked based on all of the 
        other restaurant websites I was gathering inspiration from. I chose a design that was similar to Luna De Xelajú’s
        original design and one that would match the atmosphere inside Luna De Xelajú. As the sole designer on this 
        project, I was responsible for analyzing the original website, creating wireframes, and 
        implementing design improvements in the final prototypes. This project provided me with valuable 
        hands-on experience in UI/UX design and furthered my understanding of the iterative design process.
