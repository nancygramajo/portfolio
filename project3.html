        <h2>Designing a guide for the new computer science requirements at Brown University</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="context">
      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>Brown University recently revised its concentration (major) requirements for Computer Science. For this project, which 
        we worked on as a submission to Hack@Brown 2024, 
        my team and I decided to create a prototype for a website that walks through what these new concentration requirements are, 
        acting as a guide for new and returning students. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>Brown University's current website for information on the Computer Science concentration is lengthy and can be 
        difficult to navigate.
        As computer science students, we thought about challenges we have encountered with the current website and how we can 
        redesign it to better serve students and our needs.

    <div class="research">
      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>We noticed that the existing website has a lot of text which can be overwhelming for students to read through.
        As students in the concentration, we found ourselves having to reread the website multiple times in order to 
        fully understand what the requirements are and which courses are required for each area within CS.

      <h3>Process</h3>

      <div class="wireframe 1">
        <h4>First Wireframe</h4>
        <p>We began by discussing our design ideas and putting them into a low-fidelity wireframe in Figma.</p>
      </div>

      <img src="images/first low-fi cs 2.png" class="wire1-picture">

      <div class="wireframe 2">
        <h4>Second Wireframe</h4>
        <p>In this iteration of our design, we decided to make our website a single scrolling page. </p>
      </div>
    
      <img src="images/second low-fi cs.png" class="wire1-picture">  
      <img src="images/second low-fi cs 2.png" class="wire1-picture">

      <div class="high-fidelity">
        <h4>High-Fidelity Wireframe</h4>
        <p>We then created our high-fidelity mock up. We incorporated all of the elements from our second wireframe and agreed
          on the aesthics of the website, which are specific to Hack@Brown's 2024 space theme.

      <h3>Learnings</h3>
      <p>
        This project was my first time using Figma and implementing what I learned in my UI/UX course about design processes. 
        I was able to work on my wireframing, prototyping, and presentation skills. I felt especially passionate about this project given that we 
        were designing a website for one of the largest concentrations at Brown. Although we were not able to turn our design into code, it was a great experience
        to build a project from scratch in such a short amount of time. It was also my first time competing in a Hackathon!
