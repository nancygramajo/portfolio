      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>For this project, my team and I completed the full iterative design process for Fonda, a Google Venture Startup company.  
        We redesigned the Kitchen App to enhance their user experience. We created sketches, low-fidelity designs, and high-fidelity designs 
        for the redesign. Then, we presented our redesign to our peers and the founders for feedback.
      </p>

    <div class="problem">
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>In Fonda's Kitchen App, restaurant staff are able to manage menu items and orders. 
        But Fonda was concerned about the efficiency of their current design. Within the Kitchen App, how might we improve 
        the ways a kitchen staff member can make adjustments to menu items in the quickest, most accurate way possible? 
        More specifically, how do we improve the user flow: category, item, modifiers and options? 
        How can they be assessed in our app?
      </p>

    <div class="research">
      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>We looked into Fonda's existing Kitchen App and their competitor's interfaces to identify areas for improvement and innovation.
        Our target audience included restaurant staff and managers so we were focused on designing for their specific needs and workflows.
        We also asked several clarifying questions on menu organization, consistency with customer views, customization options, and 
        efficient navigation. 
      </p>
      <p>Some of our questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"To enhance menu management, are we proposing a reorganization where food items are categorized? From what we understand, 
          users select a category, then a food item, and then view the ingredients for each item. Is this the desired user 
          flow, or is there room for change?"
        </li>
        <li>"Should the menu layout mirror what customers see? Considering that all workers may not need to view prices, are we aiming 
          for a simplified version visually focused on item details for internal use?"
        </li>
        <li>"Regarding worker interaction, how customizable should the interface be? In past experiences, have there been specific codes or acronyms 
          for streamlined workflows? We believe a cleaner interface could enhance efficiencyâ€”what level of customization is ideal?"
        </li>
        <li>
          "In designing the interface, what elements should take priority on a single screen? For example, should the ingredients list 
          have a dedicated page or appear as a pop-up for quick access?"
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="process">
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <h4>Sketching</h4>
      <p>
        We began by each sketching 2 different user flows each with 4 distinct screens. This gave us 32 sketches to draw
        inspiration from. 
      </p>
      <div class="sketches">

        <img src="images/sketches 3.png">
        <img src="images/sketches 4.png">
      </div>

      <div class="wireframe 1">
        <h4>First Wireframe</h4>
        <p>We spoke about our sketches and agreed on a design. We created our first low-fidelity wireframe in Figma.</p>
      </div>
  
      <img src="images/first wireframe.png" class="wire1-picture">


      <div class="feedback">
        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <p>We presented our first wireframe to some of our peers and the founders. These are some notes on their feedback:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            too much white space on the top
          </li>
          <li>
            search bar is too tiny
          </li>
          <li>
            image alignment isn't consistent across other screens
          </li>
          <li>
            need to activate/deactivate full food item as well (along with their selections)
          </li>
          <li>
            perhaps a "back" and "confirmed" button on last page
          </li>
        </ul>

      </div>
      <div class="wireframe 2">
        <h4>Second Wireframe</h4>
        <p>With the feedback we received, we began making changes to our first wireframe and created our second low-fidelity wireframe.
          In this second wireframe, we edited the top of the first screen to minimize the white space and made the search bar larger. 
          We kept the layout of the images and checkboxes consistent across all screens by keeping the images on the left and the checkboxes on the right.
          We also included "back" and "continue" buttons on the confirmation page. Lastly, 
          we allow users to select multiple food items at the same time while also being able to activate and deactivate individual food items.
        </p>
      </div>
    
      <img src="images/second wireframe.png" class="wire1-picture">  
      
      <div class="high-fidelity">
        <h4>High-Fidelity Wireframe</h4>
        <p>We then created our high-fidelity mock up. We incorporated all of the elements from our second wireframe in addition to two new features. 
          We created an "add" button for each dish so that restaurant staff are able to customize their menu items. We also made the design choice
          of crossing out of the menu item when it is deactivated so restaurant staff can visually differentiate 
          between the active and inactive food items.

      <h3>Learnings</h3>
      <p>
        This project provided valuable insights into the iterative design process, the importance of feedback, 
        collaboration, and flexibility in addressing design challenges. Collaborating in a team brought a lot of  
        creativity and problem-solving which taught me about the benefits of collective efforts and diverse perspectives in achieving 
        design goals. I was able to build upon several skills, which included sketching, wireframing, prototyping, and presenting design concepts. 
        Overall, this was a great opportunity to engage with a real company and product.
